# SAS-TENSILE-STRENGTH
SAS TENSILE STRENGHT
Tensile Strength Prediction Project
This project includes SAS scripts for predicting tensile strength using regression analysis and ANOVA. The dataset contains information related to material properties and their impact on tensile strength.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict the tensile strength of materials based on various features and perform statistical analyses to understand the relationships between these features and tensile strength.
Prerequisites :SAS OnDemand for Academics: Ensure you have access to SAS OnDemand for Academics or SAS Studio.
SAS Code: This project includes SAS scripts for data analysis.
